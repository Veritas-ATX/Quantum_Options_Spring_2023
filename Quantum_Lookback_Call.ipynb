    "Benefits to this approach:\n",
    "- Can run multiple small quantum circuits (perhaps in parallel).\n",
    "- Small circuits would be less error prone both in number of gates needed and total qubits on actual hardware.\n",
    "  - For lots of timesteps, getting all of the values for each step could be impractical in total number of qubits (add however many are for prob dist plus add ancillas)\n",
    "- Can simulate timesteps with different underlying uncertainty models fairly easily\n",
    "  - Say the trend is different according to a holiday or season, so the prob model needs to change in those times\n",
    "  \n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "- Takes longer to run if not in parallel\n",
    "- Can be a rough approximation, so not very accurate depending on time steps used\n",
    "  - But so are \"regular\" quantum approaches (at least in \"Option Pricing using Quantum Computers\" from Stamatopoulos et al. and similar work)"
